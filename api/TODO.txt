Wrap new API, only track_history remains.

> di.fm/login with post formvalues gives cookie.
> Save cookie in config file if user wants that
> Get http://www.di.fm/webplayer3/config for full channellist and membership type etc. Just one big blob, walk over some arrays to map by id and/or keys
> After startup, only required to do track_history calls for channels to get latest tracks.

> api.Session ? with all this data?
> session.ChannelList()
> channel.TrackList()
> channel.CurrentTrack()
> channel.Banner
> channel.Asset
> channel.SimilarChannels() []int
